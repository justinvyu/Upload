List of Things To Do:

For UI:
1. Choose tag within the same screen or other smarter/smooth ways to allow user to choose the tag (see whether you can put this into work: https://github.com/bestwnh/IGLDropDownMenu );

~~2. the first screen also need a X button to for user to cancel taking pictures;~~

~~3. Adding caption text box could be prettier - think some ways to make it look cleaner and more consistant with the rest of the screen.~~ MAYBE DONE

For Data:
